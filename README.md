# Graphs with distance sensors
Class project - M2 ORCO - UGA

Given a graph G and a set S of vertices equipped with "distance sensors" (that is, the pairwise distances between the vertices of S in G can be determined at all times by the sensors). We say that S can detect edge-failures if for any edge e, the removal of e in G changes the distance between *at least* one pair of vertices of S.

**What is the minimum size of a set of vertices that can detect edge-failures ?**
